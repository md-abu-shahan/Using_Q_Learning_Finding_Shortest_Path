# Using_Q_Learning_Finding_Shortest_Path
Reinforcement learning in formal terms is a method of machine learning where in the software agent learns to perform certain actions in an environment which lead it to maximum reward. It does so by exploration and exploitation of knowledge it learns by repeated trials of maximizing the reward.
The main goal of this project to find path from random starting point to specific end point
